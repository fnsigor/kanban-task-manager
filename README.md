## About
<p>The main reason for undertaking this project is to take my portfolio to "the next level." I also aimed to improve my DOM manipulation skills with React. To maintain fidelity to the original layout, it was necessary to use the Radix UI component library.</p>
<p>
Initially, data storage was planned to be done using Google Firebase. However, due to the limitations of the free plan of this tool, I chose to save the data in localStorage.</p>
<p>
Undertaking this project was beneficial for gaining a better understanding of React's re-rendering process. Additionally, I realized the need to use TypeScript in more complex applications.</p>
